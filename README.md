Apache Directory LDAP API
=========================

The Apache Directory LDAP API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a "schema aware" API with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP servers, not only ApacheDS but any LDAP server.

The API is OSGI ready and extensible. New controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future.
